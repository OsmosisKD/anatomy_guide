  p.
    All muscles in the anterior forearm are innervated by the <u>median</u> nerve except for
    the <u>flexor carpi ulnaris</u> which is innervated by the ulnar nerve and the <u>flexor digitorum
    profundus</u> which is innervated by both the median and ulnar nerves.
  p.
    All muscles in the superficial group of the anterior forearm are supplied
    by the <u>ulnar</u> artery except the <u>pronator teres</u> which is supplied by both
    the <u>ulnar and radial</u> arteries.
