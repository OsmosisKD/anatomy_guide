  p.
    All the muscles of the medial compartment of the thigh are innervated by
    the <u>obturator</u> nerve except for the <u>pectineus</u> which is also
    innervated by the <u>femoral</u> nerve and the <u>superficial part of the adductor magnus</u>
    which is innervated only by the <u>tibial</u>.
  p.
    The <u>obturator</u> artery supplies the pectineus, obturator externus,
    and adductor minimus. The <u>deep femoral</u> artery supplies the adductor longus,
    adductor brevis, and adductor magnus. The <u>medial circumflex femoral</u> artery
    supplies the gracilis.
