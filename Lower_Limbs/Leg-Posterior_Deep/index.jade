  p.
    All the muscles of the posterior compartment of the leg are innervated by
    the <u>tibial</u> nerve.
  p.
    The tibialis posterior and flexor digitorum longus are supplied by the
    <u>posterior tibial</u> artery. The flexor hallucis longus is supplied by
    the <u>peroneal artery</u> which is a branch of the <u>posterior tibial</u>
    artery. The popliteus is supplied by the <u>popliteal</u> artery.
