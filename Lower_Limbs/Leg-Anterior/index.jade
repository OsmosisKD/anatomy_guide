  p.
    All the muscles of the anterior compartment of the leg are innervated by
    the <u>deep fibular/peroneal</u> nerve. This is a very important nerve
    to remember due to its role in <u>foot drop</u> due to the loss of action
    of the <u>tibialis anterior</u>.
  p.
    All the muscles of the anterior compartment of the leg are supplied by
    the <u>anterior tibial</u> artery.
